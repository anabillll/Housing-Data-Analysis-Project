# Housing Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing a housing dataset to gain insights and build predictive models. The objectives include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

## Project Structure
- `Housing Data Analysis Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all analysis and code.
- `Housing Data Analysis Project.pdf`: The exported PDF version of the notebook.
- `housing_data_cleaned.csv`: The cleaned dataset (if permitted to share).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook: `Housing Data Analysis Project.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Summary
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, ensuring consistent data types.
- **EDA**: Generating summary statistics, correlation analysis, distribution analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, normalizing/standardizing data, encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Building**: Building and evaluating Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor models.

## Conclusion
- The Random Forest Regressor performed the best with RMSE of X and RÂ² of Y.
- The project showcases skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deriving insights from data.

## Next Steps
- Model fine-tuning
- Feature expansion
- Cross-validation
- Deployment
